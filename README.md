# Robotics
Trying to create a library of clean coded classes for embedded robotics and other stuff. Hopefully will have some fun playing around with C++, electronics, IoT etc.

I'm using platformio to build and upload my code to arduino. Intending to add here some more details and an example of a arduino client using some of the framework classes.
